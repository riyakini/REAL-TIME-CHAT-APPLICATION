DOMAIN: FULL STACK WEB DEVELOPMENT


DURATION: 4 WEEKS


MENTOR: NEELA SANTOSH


This Real-Time Chat Application was developed as part of my internship with Codetech IT Solutions under the guidance of Mentor Neela Santosh. The project serves as a practical implementation of the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) combined with Socket.io for real-time communication.

The application enables seamless real-time messaging between users, providing a simple yet powerful interface. The project was designed to meet the internship objectives of building a scalable web application with a focus on real-time updates, user authentication, and responsive design.

Features

🎨 User Interface
The chat interface is simple yet modern, built using React.js and styled with CSS/Tailwind CSS.
The layout includes a message area, an input field for typing messages, and an intuitive send button.
A dedicated "Video Call" button is prominently placed, suggesting future integration for video chat functionality.

📢 Real-Time Messaging
Socket.io enables instant message delivery and updates without refreshing the page.
Messages are dynamically styled to differentiate between the sender and receiver.

The idea for this project came from the growing demand for real-time communication tools in both personal and professional spaces. Messaging applications like WhatsApp and Slack inspired me to create a scalable and efficient chat application tailored to my learning goals.

Through this project, I aimed to enhance my skills in:

✅ Real-time communication using Socket.io

✅ Frontend development with React.js

✅ Backend API design with Node.js and Express.js

✅ Database integration with MongoDB
